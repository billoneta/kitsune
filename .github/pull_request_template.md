## Summary

What does this PR do, and why should we care?

Be crystal clear—vague descriptions slow us down.

> [!CAUTION]
> Saying “Fixes bug” is like saying “Food tastes good” — true, but not helpful.

> [!TIP]
> Instead, say something like “Update README with local setup instructions.” or “Correct variable scope issue in core.”

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> [!NOTE] 
> **Example:**  
> - Updates README to include step-by-step local setup guide.
> - Fixes a variable scope bug that was crashing the core processing logic.

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
